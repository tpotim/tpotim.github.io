"content" : "Actually, a kid can get a lot from computer games. The team spirit is a virtue which can be obtained from games like dota and WOW. When you are involved in such games, you will get to know that you should  be unselfish and watch your teammates back at anytime as long as you want to win. For instance, when my cousin was a little boy, he used to play dota for one hour every day after school. "
