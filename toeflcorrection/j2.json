"title" : "People care more about public recognition than about money",
"content" : "Everybody has a motivator supporting him or her to work hard. Some may deem earning money as the ultimate goal of hard work for instance, while I refute that opinion. Our world is ripe with individuals who care not so much about money, so even if the day comes when nothing is given in return for their effort, other kinds of momentums like public recognition can still impel them to work harder.",
"comment":"批改中..I am not saying that money is of no importance to us, but obviously, public recognition plays a much more essential role for us to work hard. No matter we speak of famous people or us ordinary ones, the motivation of public recognition is always stronger."
